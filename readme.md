# Compute Version GitHub Action

"Compute Version" is a GitHub Action designed to automate version computation in CI/CD pipelines, utilizing branch names and git tags. Optimized for projects using trunk-based development practices and adhering to Semantic Versioning (SemVer), it dynamically generates version numbers to streamline deployments and releases.

## Trunk-Based Development and SemVer

This action excels in environments that favor trunk-based development, where frequent merges are made to a single branch, typically `main` or `master`. By integrating with SemVer, it promotes consistent and meaningful version increments, ensuring version management aligns with continuous integration principles.

We support branches prefixed for various stages:
- `feature/(optional Jira card ID)`
- `develop`
- `main`

While other branch names can be used, `develop` and `main` are designated for development builds and production builds, respectively.

## Features

- **Git Tag Analysis**: Identifies the latest version tag to align with SemVer practices.
- **Dynamic Version Generation**: Creates version numbers based on the commit context, suitable for trunk-based development's linear history.
- **Initial Project Versioning**: Sets a default version (`0.1.0`) for new projects, providing a standardized versioning starting point.
- **JIRA Card ID Integration**: Optionally includes JIRA card IDs from commit messages or branch names in the version, enhancing traceability.
- **Version Validation**: Ensures the generated version adheres to Semantic Versioning 2.0, Docker tag, and OCI tag standards.

## Usage in Trunk-Based Development

### Pre-requisites

- Ensure your project follows a trunk-based development workflow.
- Check out the repository using `actions/checkout@v3` before executing this action.

### Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Compute and Use Version

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  versioning:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        name: Checkout repository
      
      - name: Compute Version
        id: compute_version
        uses: ActionsCI/ComputeVersion@1.0.0
        with:
          test_version_tag: '' # Optional for testing purposes
        
      - name: Use Computed Version
        run: echo "Computed version: ${{ steps.compute_version.outputs.version }}"
```
